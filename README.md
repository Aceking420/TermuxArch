This BASH setup shell script will attempt to set Arch Linux up in a Termux PRoot environment with or without QEMU support.  Emulated computer architectures `armeabi-v7a`, `x86` and `x86-64` are supported on `arm64-v8a` architecture smartphones.  Emulated computer architecture `x86` is supported on `armeabi-v7a` architecture smartphones.  The command `setupTermuxArch h[elp]` has more information.

Please see [install](https://TermuxArch.github.io/docsTermuxArch/install) for options how to run [`setupTermuxArch`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TermuxArch/TermuxArch/master/setupTermuxArch) on device, or simply run `bash setupTermuxArch` once this BASH script is downloaded to install [Arch Linux](https://github.com/archlinux) in [Termux](https://github.com/termux).  When successfully completed, the  pleasure of experiencing the Linux command prompt in Arch Linux [Termux PRoot](https://github.com/termux/proot) in Android, Chromebook, Fire OS and Windows on smartphone, tablet, wearable and similar will be in power your hand.

[PRoot](https://termuxarch.github.io/docsTermuxArch/PRoot) has more information about Linux on device with Termux.

Please share https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Development everwhereüåéüåçüåèüåê!

Install Arch Linux into a Termux PRoot container with [`curl -OL https://TermuxArch.github.io/TermuxArch/setupTermuxArch && bash setupTermuxArch`](https://github.com/TermuxArch/TermuxArch/blob/master/setupTermuxArch).  After succesfull installation start the container with `startarch`.

Please see https://TermuxArch.github.io/TermuxArch/docs/install for options how to run [`setupTermuxArch`](https://github.com/TermuxArch/TermuxArch/blob/master/setupTermuxArch) on device.

Please see  https://TermuxArch.github.io/docsTermuxArch/startingArch for options how to start the Arch Linux container `startarch` on device.  If you find any errors, then please feel free open both a pull request, and an accompanying issue referencing it in the appropriate repository.

This repository uses submodules.  To get all the pieces of this repository you can run the following code after cloning in the root directory of this repository:

#### FACTS ABOUT THIS PROJECT:

The core dataset can be viewed and tooled to your wish and desire with command `setupTermuxArch bloom` which should download all the components of TermuxArch into directory HOME/TermuxArchBloom in the Termux HOME directory.  The command `setupTermuxArch bloom` is much like the command `setupTermuxArch manual`;  The bloom option is more expansive than `setupTermuxArch manual` which is primarily used for mirror selection, and can be used to tune the PRoot init statement.  Bloom is a much more verbose option in that it provides the CLI user the entire code dataset.  Please feel free to use the commands `setupTermuxArch h[e[lp]]` for additional information how to use `setupTermuxArch`.

Files `setupTermuxArch.{bash,sh}` are held for backward compatibility;  Please reference file `setupTermuxArch` as the chosen install file if aid and assistance be through sharing insight about this Arch Linux in a Termux PRoot container project which can be used on a smartphone, smartTV, tablet, wearable and more.  File `setupTermuxArch` is earmarked as the install file name for this project.

File `setupTermuxArch` downloads as files `setupTermuxArch.[bin,\ \(1\),\ \(2\),etc...]`' through Internet browsers into Android Downloads on smartphone and Arch Linux in Termux PRoot can be installed directly from this file in Android with this command `bash ~/storage/downloads/setupTermuxArch` and similar which may also check whether there is a newer version automatically since the time it was downloaded.  If there is a newer version, this file will self update.  If this updating process went smoothly, this file will restart the process that was initially initiated by the user.

These files `setupTermuxArch[.{bash,sh}]` will NOT selfupdate to the most recent version published if they are used inside their git repository;  You can use commands `git pull && git submodule update --init --remote --recursive` and `pullTermuxArchMods.bash` to update to the newest version published.
